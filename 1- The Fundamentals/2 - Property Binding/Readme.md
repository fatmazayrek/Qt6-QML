I did a simple example about property bindig. Property binding allows connection between properties. 

There are 3 circle on the window. Height property of the pink one is binding its width property. 
•	When you click the brown circle, width of the pink circle increases and depends on it height value of the pink increases. 
•	When you click the yellow one, binding of the height and width of the pink circle changes.
