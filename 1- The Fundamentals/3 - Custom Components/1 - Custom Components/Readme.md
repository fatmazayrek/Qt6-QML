## Custom Components 📗

Using a separate module to customize items is more beneficial in terms of code readability 🗂️

In this example, I created a button using Rectangle Item and customized it. Then, I aligned them using Column Component.🛂

When you click the buttons, it writes to console which button you clicked.🖱️
